# YMarket

A one-stop marketplace app that serves the buying and selling needs of Yale affliates.

## Tech Stack

- React Native
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Imgur API

## Running the App

Start two terminals. In one of the terminals, make sure you are in the root backend directory. You can run the server for the backend as follows:

```
python manage.py runserver
```

You may also need to run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`, which you will be prompted to do so if needed upon running the server.

In the second terminal, make sure you are in the root frontend directory and have expo installed. You can then start the app:
```
npm install --global expo-cli
expo start
```
Our app can currently be simulated on XCode (or the Windows equivalent) and not ExpoGo. 

## Installing Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run the following in the root project directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, in the root frontend directory, install yarn:
```
yarn install
```

## Testing

Please look at the dev branch for the most updated version of the codebase.

### Frontend

We are using `jest` to create tests. In each directory that contains files that need to be tested, there should be a `__tests__` folder, and possibly a `__snapshots__` sub-folder. So far, we have written a few basic unittests that check if a screen's contents have loaded and snapshot tests for the authorization screens.

To run the tests, type `yarn test` into the terminal.

### Backend

We are using the `APITestCase` class from Django's REST framework. This class mirrors the existing Django test case classes, but it uses `APIClient` instead of Django's default `Client`. For each feature implemented, there should be a `tests.py` file in the appropriate feature subdirectory. Currently, there are unit tests for the post API in `/posts/tests.py` and for the user authentication system API in `/users/tests.py`. Because our post API requires authentication by nature, there is integration testing between the authentication system and the post API.

To run the tests, type `python manage.py test` into the terminal.

### CI/CD

We have set up a basic CI/CD workflow in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. On pushes and pull requests to the dev and main branches, this CI will run two jobs: `Test Server` and `Test Client`. For now, these jobs simply install the necessary dependencies for our app and run the tests that we have created.
