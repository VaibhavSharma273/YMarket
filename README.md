# YMarket

A one-stop marketplace app that serves the buying and selling needs of Yale affliates.

## Tech Stack

- React Native
- Django
- PostgreSQL/SQLite
- Imgur API

## Installing Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run the following in the root project directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, in the root frontend directory, install npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the App

Start two terminals. In one of the terminals, make sure you are in the root backend directory. You can run the server for the backend as follows:

```bash
python manage.py runserver <IP ADDRESS>:8000
```

In order to use the Expo Go app on your IOS devices and the standard Expo IOS simulator, please open `url.ts` in `/frontend/constants` and modify `hostURL`, replacing the placeholder with your network IP address. Then run the above command with that same IP address.

You may also need to run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`, which you will be prompted to do so if needed upon running the server.

In the second terminal, make sure you are in the root frontend directory and have expo installed. You can then start the app:

```bash
npm install --global expo-cli
expo start
```

Our app can currently be simulated on XCode (or the Windows equivalent) and Expo Go.

## Testing

Please look at the `dev` branch for the most updated version of the codebase.

### Frontend

We are using `jest` to create tests. In each directory that contains files that need to be tested, there should be a `__tests__` folder, and possibly a `__snapshots__` sub-folder. So far, we have written a few basic unittests that check if a screen's contents have loaded and snapshot tests for the authorization screens.

To run the tests, type `npm test` into the terminal.

### Backend

We are using the `APITestCase` class from Django's REST framework. This class mirrors the existing Django test case classes, but it uses `APIClient` instead of Django's default `Client`. For each feature implemented, there should be a `tests.py` file in the appropriate feature subdirectory. Currently, there are unit tests for the post API in `/posts/tests.py`, for the user authentication system API in `/users/tests.py`, and for the messaging API in `/messages/tests.py`. Because our post API requires authentication by nature, there is integration testing between the authentication system and the other APIs.

To run the tests, type `python manage.py test` into the terminal.

### CI/CD

We have set up a basic CI/CD workflow in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. On pushes and pull requests to the dev and main branches, this CI will run two jobs: `Test Server` and `Test Client`. For now, these jobs simply install the necessary dependencies for our app and run the tests that we have created.
